Now I am pursuing my master degree of  software engineering in University of Melbourne. Well, I finished my bachelor degree in Hunan University, one of Top 10 universities in China. After graduation, to pursue further education and  experience diverse cultures and life, I chose the best university in Australia, well I think my university is.  While, I am a total fresher in the market, without many experiences, but I have strong willingness to learn new stuff, new technologies or algorithms. And I also have the ability of quick learning, applying knowledge into practical development.  (And also from my previous subject experiences aligned well with this position’s requirement, I think I can fit this position.) </em></p>

And I also a team player, I would like to communicate with colleagues, share ideas and solve all problems in a better way. </em></p>

Describe a project you have done, and describe your role and responsibility in that project</h3><p><em> I would like to talk about a recent subject project- Touch Frame. This is an cross-platform mobile  application to provide services for carers to monitor and manage the health condition of elder persons who lives alone. It is a big project so I have 8 team mates and we apply agile process to develop. The main technology is Node js as back-end development and react framework to handle front-end development. </em></p>

And I am always self-motivated and have a long- term ambition which pushes me to finish work to satisfy both quality and time requirement. And I try to be more optimistic and flexible to get used to different situations in order to calm down and finish tasks efficiently. </em></p>

Describe a challenge you have met</h3><p><em> I have faced many challenges in my life. Actually I think life itself is a big challenge. Everyday we have to come across different problems, resolve them and learn from mistakes.  Well, the toughest challenge I have met recently is a big change I have met for one of my subject projects. I have to finish an enterprise project within one semester instead of a whole year with my teammates. It is because at the beginning of 2nd semester, the client of the project changed. So the entire direction, technology and strategy had to change. Initially, my team members were frustrated and lack of confidence of completing this project on time. But I know this is the truth and I have to accept it without other choices. So I selected the relevant part of work from previous semester, encouraged my team members to catch up other group’s progress, and negotiated with new clients about current situation and finally persuaded him to decide the at least part that have to do. So after my hard work and dedication, my team members cheered up and hard work again. So finally we finished the project perfectly. </em></p>

You know, in end of each semester, there would be several assignment or project from different subjects which always due in same time period. So to handle this situation, I always list all my tasks and separate them into 4 levels. The easy and urgent ones, the hard but urgent ones, the easy and not urgent ones and hard and not urgent ones. Then I would deal with different kind of tasks respectively in this sequence. And this method  always works and turns out a fair outcome. </em></p>
